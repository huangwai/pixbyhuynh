# Welcome to PixByHuynh 
Made in React.js incorperating Material UI

### Small Description:
I am a passionate photographer with a keen eye for capturing moments in time. I have a strong 
understanding of lighting, composition, and technical aspects of photography, and use this knowledge
to bring out the beauty in every subject I shoot. Whether I am taking photos of people, landscapes,
or still life, I aim to tell a story through my images and create art that evokes emotion. I am constantly 
learning and experimenting with new techniques, and am always striving to improve my craft. My ultimate goal 
is to use my talent to bring joy to others and to preserve memories that will last a lifetime.

As a result, I wanted to leverage my knowledge in front-end development and post all my favorite pictures and albums
to showcase my art and to hopefully expand to to achieve greater opportunities.
